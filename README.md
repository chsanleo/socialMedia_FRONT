# FrontEnd, socialMedia
![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/working-active-brig)

FrontEnd proposed as a final project to show our improvements with the different tools we study across the FullStack Bootcamp. 
For the current project we will use React as a technology to work with the fronted with Redux. 

We wanted to go further and we installed different libraries, adding some extra features to our applications like the use of a Datepicker, Redux, Bootstrap and so on. 

## How to Start 🚀

+ To use all our solution the best is clone our back first: 
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/chsanleo/socialMedia_BACK
```

+ and install the packages,

```
$ npm install
```

+ run the migrations to create the database

```
$ sequelize db:migrate
```

+ populate the database with basic data

```
$ sequelize db:seed:all
```
 
+ take a look to the /config/ files, where u need to take the samples and create ur own config files

+ clone the front repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chsanleo/socialMedia_FRONT
```

+ and install the packages,

```
$ npm install
```

+ run both, back and front in the source folder

```
$ npm start
```

+ and... WORK!.
